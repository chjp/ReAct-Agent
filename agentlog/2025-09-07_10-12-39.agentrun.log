üí≠ Thought: Now I need to create the JavaScript file with the game logic. The snake game will need to handle:
1. Game initialization and canvas setup
2. Snake movement and controls
3. Food generation
4. Collision detection
5. Score tracking
6. Game over handling

I'll implement a basic snake game with arrow key controls.
